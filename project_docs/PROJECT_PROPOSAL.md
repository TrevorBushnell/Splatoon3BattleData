# Project Proposal

## 0. Review of Project

As from before, I am building a project surrounding my Splatoon 3 battle data. Using Streamlit, I will create a dashboard to display various aspects of my battle data as well as the data of every match that takes place worldwide. I will also do machine learning models to predict the outcomes of matches based on the weapons and gear abilities chosen by players in the match.

## 1. Main Motivation

This game pisses me off. I want to have fun, but I lose more than I win. Considering this is a children's game, I always blame my teammates for my loss. While the age of every player is anonymized, data on their performance can still be compared to my performance. As such, I can compare my performance to the performance of my teammates to see if I actually am that much better than everyone else on my team.

Additionally, I don't ever have any good gear loadouts. In Splatoon, you can have 3 pieces of gear equipped on your body. Each piece of gear has 1 main slot and 3 sub slots which can hold abilities. These abilities include recharging your ink faster, using less ink per shot, increasing your running speed, and more. The abilities you get on gear that you buy are randomized, but you can spend money and other resources to get custom gear builds. I would love to be able to see what the gear loadouts of players around the world are so that I can make informed decisions on what gear loadouts I should be building for my character. 

Finally, weapons are always changing in Splatoon. There are always "bad" weapons that rarely get used, and "good" weapons that are used constantly in matches. Additionally, new weapons get released roughly every 60 days and balance patches are introduced that change how certain weapons operate. If this proejct stays up, I can see what weapons are used in battles and if it changes as new weapons are added and other weapons are changed.
