# Worldwide Data

THIS PAGE NEEDS TO BE IMPLEMENTED

At the very least I will display the same kinds of statistics that I would be display on my main page, except this time it would just be for all the worldwide data (close to roughly 8.5 million instances). These first all need to be stored in a BigQuery database because my GitHub repo is getting quite massive to be hosting all of this data here on GitHub.
